# A quantum-based approach for supervised learning (bachelor thesis) 

This repository provides code for comparing classical kernel models with their quantum-hybrid counterparts. We've trained and evaluated these models on real-world biomedical data to investigate whether the quantum-hybrid versions can achieve a better performance than their classical counterparts, potentially demonstrating a quantum advantage.

## Welcome to QMLab! ðŸ§ª

The package we created is called `QMLab` - written entirely in Python, using [Pennylane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane) for simulation of a quantum mechanical backend and [Sklearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) for the classical backend. The main class we use is [`QSVC`]() - short for **Q**uantum **S**upport **V**ector **C**lassifier. It inherits from the [`SVC`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/svm/_classes.py#L604) class of Scikit-Learn and extends its functionality by allowing a quantum kernel as well as classical ones.

## Information about the data ðŸ§¬

We're dealing with 9 different biomedical datasets in the thesis. The collection is coming from the study of <cite>Jacqueline Beinecke & Dominik Heider [[1]]</cite> that comparse different augmentation methods for 
dealing with the imbalance in biomedical data.
All of the datasets don't consist of a large number of examples $m$, but have the high class imbalance and 
a large number of features $d$. 

| **NAME**      | $m$  | Cases (+1)   | Controls (-1)   | $d$ |
|---------------|------|--------------|-----------------|-----|                 
| **SOBAR**     | 72   | 21           | 51              | 19  |
| **NAFLD**     | 74   | 22           | 52              | 9   |
| **Fertility** | 100  | 12           | 88              | 9   |
| **WPDC**      | 198  | 47           | 151             | 32  |
| **Haberman**  | 306  | 81           | 225             | 3   |
| **HCV**       | 546  | 20           | 526             | 12  |
| **WDBC**      | 569  | 212          | 357             | 30  |
| **CCRF**      | 761  | 17           | 744             | 7   |
| **Heroin**    | 942  | 97           | 845             | 11  |
| **CTG**       | 1831 | 176          | 1655            | 22  |

In the original paper different algorithms for data augmentation in order to deal with the imbalance 
have been compared.
We have implemented a quantum kernel classifier from {\cite havlicek here} and compared its performance 
to common kernel classifiers known from traditional machine learning, like the rbf or polynomial 
kernel.

## What is a Quantum Support Vector Machine? ðŸ¤”

Since real quantum hardware is noisy and prone for errors a whole field submerged of quantum hybrid algorithms 
which are based on classical learning algorithms but outsource suitable parts to a quantum computer.

The traditional support vector machine algorithm can only classify data that is linearly separable. 
It becomes way more powerful when we introduce a class of functions called **kernels**. 
Kernels allow us to map our data in a higher, perhaps infinite dimensional space where it is linearly separable. 
Therefore we can classify non-linearly separable data with a linear model.

A **quantum kernel** is a function

## Installation and Tests 
Create a new python environment using 
```shell 
python -m venv ~/myvirtualenv 
```
or if you are using `python3`: 
```shell 
python3 -m venv ~/myvirtualenv
```
and then install all of the required packages via:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
for unix operating systems.
Check if all tests of the project (Add the `-v` for verbose output) run:
```shell
pytest -v 
```
Additionally run all tests with coverage:
```shell
pytest -v --cov=src/qmlab tests/   
```
