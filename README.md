# A quantum-based approach for supervised learning (bachelor thesis) 

This repository provides the code for comparing classical machine learning models with their quantum-hybrid based versions. 

## Welcome to QMLab! ðŸ§ª

The package created is called `QMLab` - it is completely written in Python using `Qiskit` for the quantum mechanical and `Scikit-Learn` for the classical backend. The main class used is called 
:code:`QSVC` - short for **Quantum Support Vector Machine**. It is inheriting from the :code:`SVC`-class of 
from `Scikit-Learn`.

## Information about the biomedical datasets ðŸ§¬

We're dealing with 9 different datasets in this thesis. The collection is coming from <cite>Jacqueline Beinecke & Dominik Heider[1]</cite>
