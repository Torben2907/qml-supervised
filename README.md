# A quantum-based approach for supervised learning (bachelor thesis) ðŸŽ‰

This repository provides the code for comparing classical machine learning models with their quantum-hybrid based versions. 
The package used is called `QMLab` - it is completely written in Python using `Qiskit` for the quantum mechanical and `Scikit-Learn` for the classical backend. The main class used is called 
:code:`QSVC` - short for **Quantum Support Vector Machine**. It is inheriting from the :code:`SVC`-class of 
from `Scikit-Learn`.
